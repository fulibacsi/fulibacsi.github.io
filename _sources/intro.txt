Prelude to Python 101
=====================

This site will feature various materials to learn
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
and the basics of
`programming <http://sahandsaba.com/thirty-python-language-features-and-tricks-you-may-not-know.html>`_,
`data cleansing <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_,
`web scraping <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_,
`visualising <http://pbpython.com/visualization-tools-1.html>`_
and - hopefully -
`many more <http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/>`_.

Most likely you're already aware of
`Python <http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/Python.html>`_
and (probably) you have some cumbersome task you want to automate, or a problem
you'd like to solve. The intent behind this project is the lend you a hand and
show some easy fix for them.

This page will refresh regularly.
